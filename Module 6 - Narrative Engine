# Module 6 – Narrative Engine
**Structure of Simulation Story & Meaning**

---

### Description

The Narrative Engine composes the simulation experience into meaningful stories based on choice, resonance, karma, and *The Source*. It ensures that each entity’s journey aligns with their blueprint and carries transformative value.

---

### Functions

- Generate narratives based on player choices and karmic evolution.
- Ensure the story is meaningful and aligned with soul blueprints.
- Support conscious evolution through narrative experiences.
